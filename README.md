# Data Professional Survey Breakdown with Power BI

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze data from a survey conducted among data professionals. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as the number of survey respondents by country, their average salaries based on job roles, age distribution, work-life balance satisfaction, salary satisfaction, and more. The data was sourced from the GitHub account of AlexTheAnalyst.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is provided by [Alex The Analyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst) on his GitHub repository. The data is stored in an Excel file named:

- **Project Data.xlsx**: Contains the survey responses, including demographic information, job roles, salary details, and satisfaction levels across various metrics.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import and Preparation**:
   - Import the `Project Data.xlsx` file into Power BI.
   - Clean and structure the data to ensure it is ready for analysis. That involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating calculated fields as needed.

2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop a Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the survey data through various interactive visualizations.
   - Key visualizations include:
     - **Survey Respondents by Country**: A breakdown of the number of survey takers from different countries.
     - **Average Salary by Job Role**: Visualization of average salaries based on different data-related job roles.
     - **Age Distribution**: Insights into the average age and age range of survey respondents.
     - **Work-Life Balance Satisfaction**: Analysis of how satisfied respondents are with their work-life balance.
     - **Salary Satisfaction**: Visualization of respondents' happiness with their current salary.
     - Additional metrics and insights derived from the survey data.

## Final Output

- **Power BI Dashboard**: The completed dashboard visualizes the survey data and is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing key insights at a glance.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Open the Power BI file containing the dashboard.
  
2. **Interact with the Dashboard**:
   - Gain insights into the distribution of respondents, salary trends, and satisfaction levels across different demographics.
